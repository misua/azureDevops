## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Deployment Notifications
The system SHALL send notifications to Slack and email for all deployment events across environments.

#### Scenario: Successful deployment notification
- **WHEN** ArgoCD successfully syncs an application
- **THEN** notification is sent to environment-specific Slack channel with deployment details (app name, version, environment, commit SHA)

#### Scenario: Failed deployment notification
- **WHEN** ArgoCD sync fails
- **THEN** critical notification is sent to Slack and email with error details and link to ArgoCD UI

#### Scenario: Deployment started notification
- **WHEN** ArgoCD begins syncing an application
- **THEN** info notification is sent to Slack indicating deployment in progress

### Requirement: Environment-Specific Routing
The system SHALL route notifications to different channels based on target environment.

#### Scenario: Production deployment alert
- **WHEN** deployment targets production environment
- **THEN** notification is sent to #prod-deployments Slack channel and ops@example.com email list

#### Scenario: Development deployment alert
- **WHEN** deployment targets dev environment
- **THEN** notification is sent to #dev-deployments Slack channel only

#### Scenario: Staging deployment alert
- **WHEN** deployment targets staging environment
- **THEN** notification is sent to #staging-deployments Slack channel and qa@example.com email list

### Requirement: Notification Content
The system SHALL include comprehensive deployment metadata in notifications for traceability.

#### Scenario: Notification includes deployment metadata
- **WHEN** deployment notification is sent
- **THEN** message includes application name, environment, image tag, commit SHA, commit message, author, and ArgoCD sync status

#### Scenario: Notification includes observability links
- **WHEN** deployment notification is sent
- **THEN** message includes links to Grafana dashboard, ArgoCD application, and relevant logs/traces

### Requirement: Alert Aggregation
The system SHALL aggregate multiple deployment events to prevent notification spam.

#### Scenario: Batch notifications for multiple apps
- **WHEN** multiple applications deploy within 5 minutes

#### Scenario: Suppress duplicate notifications
- **WHEN** ArgoCD retries a failed sync

### Requirement: Observability Alerts
The system SHALL send alerts for anomalies detected in logs, traces, and profiles.

#### Scenario: High error rate alert
- **WHEN** error log rate exceeds 5% for 5 minutes
- **THEN** alert is sent to Slack with link to error logs and traces

#### Scenario: Slow trace alert
- **WHEN** P95 request latency exceeds 2s for 10 minutes
- **THEN** alert is sent with link to slow traces and CPU profiles

#### Scenario: Memory leak detection
- **WHEN** memory usage increases by 20% over 1 hour
- **THEN** alert is sent with link to memory profiles and heap dumps
