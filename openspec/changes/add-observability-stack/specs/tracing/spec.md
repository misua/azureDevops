## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Distributed Tracing
The system SHALL capture distributed traces across the entire deployment pipeline from code commit to production using Grafana Tempo.

#### Scenario: HTTP request tracing
- **WHEN** an HTTP request is received by the application
- **THEN** a trace is created with spans for each operation, including database queries and external API calls

#### Scenario: Pipeline execution tracing
- **WHEN** CI/CD pipeline executes
- **THEN** a trace is created spanning build, test, containerization, and deployment stages

#### Scenario: Cross-service trace propagation
- **WHEN** a request spans multiple services
- **THEN** trace context is propagated via W3C Trace Context headers

### Requirement: Trace Storage
The system SHALL store traces in Grafana Tempo with Azure Blob Storage backend for cost-effective long-term retention.

#### Scenario: Trace retention
- **WHEN** traces are ingested into Tempo
- **THEN** traces are retained for 14 days with automatic cleanup

#### Scenario: Trace sampling
- **WHEN** application generates traces
- **THEN** 10% of traces are sampled in production, 100% in dev/staging

### Requirement: Trace Correlation
The system SHALL correlate traces with logs and metrics using trace ID and span ID.

#### Scenario: Logs linked to traces
- **WHEN** viewing a trace in Grafana
- **THEN** related logs are displayed inline with trace spans

#### Scenario: Metrics linked to traces
- **WHEN** viewing application metrics
- **THEN** exemplars link to corresponding traces for investigation

### Requirement: Trace Querying
The system SHALL provide TraceQL query interface through Grafana for searching traces by attributes.

#### Scenario: Query traces by duration
- **WHEN** user searches for slow requests
- **THEN** traces with duration > 1s are returned with breakdown by span

#### Scenario: Query traces by error status
- **WHEN** user filters by error status
- **THEN** only failed traces are displayed with error details
