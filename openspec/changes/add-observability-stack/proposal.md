## Why
Implement comprehensive observability to monitor the entire application lifecycle from code commit to production deployment, enabling end-to-end visibility through structured logging (Loki), distributed tracing (Tempo), continuous profiling (Pyroscope), and proactive deployment notifications (Slack/Email).

## What Changes
- **Logging**: Deploy Grafana Loki for centralized log aggregation with structured logging in application
- **Tracing**: Implement Grafana Tempo for distributed tracing across services and pipelines
- **Profiling**: Add Pyroscope for continuous application performance profiling
- **Alerting**: Configure deployment notifications to Slack and email for all environments
- **Application Instrumentation**: Add OpenTelemetry SDK to sample app for traces and metrics
- **Unified Dashboard**: Create Grafana dashboards correlating logs, traces, and profiles

## Impact
- Affected specs: `logging`, `tracing`, `profiling`, `alerting` (new capabilities)
- Affected code: Application code (instrumentation), Kubernetes manifests, monitoring stack
- Infrastructure: New deployments for Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope, updated Grafana, ArgoCD notifications
- Dependencies: Prometheus (existing), ArgoCD (existing)
