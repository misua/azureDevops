## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Repository Synchronization
The GitOps operator SHALL continuously monitor the configuration repository and synchronize changes to the target Kubernetes cluster.

#### Scenario: Automatic deployment on config change
- **WHEN** a new commit is pushed to the monitored branch in the config repository
- **THEN** the GitOps operator detects the change within 3 minutes and applies the updated manifests to the cluster

#### Scenario: Sync interval configuration
- **WHEN** the operator is configured with a custom sync interval
- **THEN** it polls the repository at the specified interval (default: 3 minutes) for changes

### Requirement: Operator Deployment
The GitOps operator SHALL be deployed to the target AKS or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster with appropriate RBAC permissions using ArgoCD.

#### Scenario: ArgoCD installation on AKS
- **WHEN** deploying ArgoCD as the GitOps operator
- **THEN** install ArgoCD using the installation script and configure repository connection using Azure DevOps credentials

#### Scenario: ArgoCD installation on Arc cluster
- **WHEN** deploying ArgoCD on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes
- **THEN** install ArgoCD with Azure Arc integration and configure repository connection using service principal credentials

### Requirement: Health Monitoring
The GitOps operator SHALL report synchronization status, health checks, and deployment errors through ArgoCD metrics and logs.

#### Scenario: Successful sync status
- **WHEN** manifests are successfully applied to the cluster
- **THEN** ArgoCD reports sync status as "Synced" with timestamp and commit SHA

#### Scenario: Deployment failure notification
- **WHEN** manifest application fails (e.g., resource quota exceeded)
- **THEN** ArgoCD reports the failure with error details and maintains the previous working state

#### Scenario: Metrics exposure
- **WHEN** monitoring the GitOps operator
- **THEN** ArgoCD exposes Prometheus metrics for sync status, reconciliation duration, and error rates

### Requirement: Rollback Capability
The GitOps operator SHALL support rollback to previous configurations by reverting commits in the configuration repository.

#### Scenario: Git-based rollback
- **WHEN** a deployment causes issues and needs rollback
- **THEN** reverting the commit in the config repository triggers automatic redeployment of the previous state

#### Scenario: Manual rollback via ArgoCD
- **WHEN** using ArgoCD CLI or UI
- **THEN** administrators can trigger rollback to a specific previous revision with `argocd app rollback` command
