## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Manifest Validation
The configuration pipeline SHALL validate all Kubernetes manifests for syntax correctness and schema compliance before allowing merges.

#### Scenario: Valid manifest passes validation
- **WHEN** a pull request contains valid Kubernetes YAML manifests
- **THEN** the validation pipeline passes and allows the PR to be merged

#### Scenario: Invalid YAML syntax detected
- **WHEN** a manifest contains YAML syntax errors
- **THEN** the validation pipeline fails with specific error details and line numbers

#### Scenario: Kubernetes schema validation
- **WHEN** manifests are validated against Kubernetes API schemas
- **THEN** the pipeline uses tools like `kubeval` or `kubeconform` to detect invalid resource definitions

### Requirement: Environment Separation
The configuration repository SHALL maintain separate directories or branches for each environment (dev, staging, production) with environment-specific configurations.

#### Scenario: Environment-specific values
- **WHEN** deploying to different environments
- **THEN** each environment has its own values file or overlay with appropriate resource limits, replicas, and configurations

#### Scenario: Production branch protection
- **WHEN** changes target the production environment
- **THEN** the configuration requires manual approval from designated reviewers before merge

### Requirement: Drift Detection
The configuration pipeline SHALL detect and report configuration drift between the repository state and cluster state.

#### Scenario: Manual cluster changes detected
- **WHEN** resources in the cluster differ from the config repository
- **THEN** the system reports drift with details of the differences and affected resources

#### Scenario: Automated drift reconciliation
- **WHEN** drift is detected and auto-sync is enabled
- **THEN** the GitOps operator automatically reconciles the cluster state to match the repository
