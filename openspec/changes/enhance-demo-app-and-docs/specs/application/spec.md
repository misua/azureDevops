## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Realistic API Endpoints
The demo application SHALL provide multiple realistic API endpoints to demonstrate observability features.

#### Scenario: Health check endpoint
- **WHEN** GET /health is called
- **THEN** application returns detailed health status including dependencies

#### Scenario: Users API with CRUD operations
- **WHEN** API endpoints are called (GET /api/users, POST /api/users, etc.)
- **THEN** application performs operations and generates traces with proper spans

#### Scenario: Orders API with business logic
- **WHEN** POST /api/orders is called
- **THEN** application simulates order processing with multiple service calls

#### Scenario: Products API with search
- **WHEN** GET /api/products?search=term is called
- **THEN** application performs search and returns results with query tracing

#### Scenario: Error simulation
- **WHEN** GET /api/error is called
- **THEN** application generates controlled errors for testing alerts

#### Scenario: Slow endpoint for latency testing
- **WHEN** GET /api/slow is called
- **THEN** application introduces artificial delay to test slow trace alerts

### Requirement: Traffic Generation
The system SHALL include a traffic generator to create realistic load patterns.

#### Scenario: Normal traffic pattern
- **WHEN** load-generator runs in normal mode
- **THEN** it generates steady traffic across all endpoints

#### Scenario: Traffic spike
- **WHEN** load-generator runs in spike mode
- **THEN** it generates sudden increase in requests

#### Scenario: Error generation
- **WHEN** load-generator runs in error mode
- **THEN** it calls error endpoints to trigger alerts

#### Scenario: Mixed workload
- **WHEN** load-generator runs in mixed mode
- **THEN** it generates realistic mix of successful, slow, and error requests
